Notes for issues:

The GET request from the JS to PHP follows through accordingly with a connection of 200 (OK) 
The RESPONSE however goes to the wrong  URL 
Potential Solution: Move files into htdocs folder so the URL response matches file directory
Other Solution: Figure out a way to redirect the return RESPONSE URL so that the main site is affected and not the PHP site.

Connection: keep-alive (check for issues with that)
